\chapter{Higgs Phenomology}
\label{sec:pheno}

Dasu -
The pheno chapter need not start from the Dirac equation and build up. It should have crisp intro to Higgs phenomenology starting from that portion of the Lagrangian. You donâ€™t need all the myriad details of SM like the quark mixing matrices, etc.

\section{Standard Model Symmetries}

\section{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}

electroweak symmetry breaking is achieved via the Brout--Englert--Higgs
mechanism~\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu,Higgs:1966ev,Kibble:1967sv},
leading, in its minimal version, to the prediction of the existence of one physical neutral scalar particle,
commonly known as the Higgs boson ($\PH$).


\section{Higgs Yukawa Couplings}
To establish the mass generation mechanism for fermions,
 it is necessary to probe the direct coupling of
the Higgs boson to such particles.
The most promising decay channel is $\Pgt^+\Pgt^-$,
because of the large event rate expected in the SM compared to the $\Pgm^+\Pgm^-$ decay channel ($\mathcal{B}(\PH\to\Pgt^+\Pgt^-)=6.3$\% for a mass of 125.09\GeV), and of the smaller contribution from background events
with respect to the $\bbbar$ decay channel.

\section{Higgs Production}

Feynman diagrams for the leading Higgs boson production processes
are shown in Figure~\ref{tab:higgs_feyn}.

The cross sections for the leading Higgs boson production processes
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_production}. The values for the leading
process are approximately: $ggH \approx 48\pb$, VBF$ \approx 3.8\pb$, $\PW\PH \approx 1.4\pb$,
and $\PZ\PH \approx 0.88\pb$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. The $\ttbar\PH$ process
which is found to be insignificant in the following analyses has a cross
section approximatly half the size of the next smallest one, $\PZ\PH$, where
$\ttbar\PH \approx 5.1\pb$.

\section{Higgs Decays}

After a Higgs boson is produced, it will decay extremly rapidly. The theorized lifetime of a Higgs
boson particle is $1.6 \times 10^{-22}$ s~\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm} meaning that, when created
inside of the CMS detector, a Higgs boson will always decay
within the CMS detector . There are multiple possible decay
paths each with their own probability or branching ratio with the largest branching ratio
processes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_decay}. The $\htt$ process has a branching
ratio of approximately 6.3\% for $\mH = 125\GeV$.

The various production cross sections and branching fractions for the SM Higgs 
boson production, and their corresponding uncertainties are taken from
