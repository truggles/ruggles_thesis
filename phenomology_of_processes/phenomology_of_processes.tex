\chapter{Phenomology of Processes}
\label{sec:pheno}

Dasu -
The pheno chapter need not start from the Dirac equation and build up. It should have crisp intro to Higgs phenomenology starting from that portion of the Lagrangian. You donâ€™t need all the myriad details of SM like the quark mixing matrices, etc.

CROSS SECTIONS
The various production cross sections and branching fractions for the SM Higgs 
boson production, and their corresponding uncertainties are taken from 
References.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz,Denner:2011mq,Ball:2011mu} and references therein.
