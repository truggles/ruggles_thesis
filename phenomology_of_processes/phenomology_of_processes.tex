\chapter{Higgs Phenomology}
\label{sec:pheno}

%Dasu -
%The pheno chapter need not start from the Dirac equation and build up. It should have crisp intro to Higgs phenomenology starting from that portion of the Lagrangian. You don’t need all the myriad details of SM like the quark mixing matrices, etc.

In this chapter I provide an increasingly mathematical description of the standard model
of physics, specifically in reference to the Higgs boson. I provide a basic overview of some 
properties of the Higgs boson including how it is created in a hadron collider, an overview
of the possible decay paths for a Higgs boson, and a discussion of the Higgs boson
couplings, or interactions, with different fundamental particles. A description of the
Higgs boson requires covering the process of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) which
provides the mathematical descripition of the process defining the Higgs boson and the
Higgs field.

\section{Standard Model Symmetries}
Many people are attracted to physics because of the beauty they see in the patterns of nature.
PW Anderson, a physics Nobel laureate, stated, ``it is only slightly overstating the case 
to say that physics is the study of symmetry''~\cite{pw_anderson:1972}.
One way of expressing many types of patterns mathematically is with symmetries, properties which 
remain invariant under certain transformations. The SM is defined by a group of symmetries
representing certain conserved properties. Specifically, the SM is represented by  the
symmetries of the unitary product group SU(3)$_{\text{C}} \,\times \,$ SU(2)$_{\text{L}} \, \times\,$ U(1)$_{\text{Y}}$.
These three terms all reflect symmetries and conserved quantities discussed below.

Electric charge ($Q$), the third component of weak isospin ($T_{3}$), and hypercharge ($Y$) act together to define a conserved 
quantity in the SM, $Q = T_{3} + \frac{Y}{2}$. This is represented by the
hypercharge U(1)$_{\text{Y}}$ symmetry group.

The two SU($n$) groups are special unitary groups which represent rotations.
In the SM, the SU(2) group provides a description of particle spin.
The ``L'' subscript for the SU(2)$_{\text{L}}$ group indicates that that it only couples to
and describest left handed fermions.
The SU(3)$_{\text{C}}$ group describes the local symmetry of color charge.


\section{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}
Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam demonstrated a unified description of the electromagnetic force 
and weak force which merge at energies of order 100\GeV into the electroweak force,
described by the electroweak Lagrangian~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,SM1,SM3}.
The electroweak Lagrangian defines a gauge field theory which is 
invariant under the SU(2)$_{\text{L}} \, \times \, $U(1)$_{\text{Y}}$ symmetry group. 
Prior to the introduction of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB),
the electroweak Lagrangian describes massless $\PW$ and $\PZ$ bosons.
However, as previously mentioned, the $\PW$ and $\PZ$ bosons were discovered in 1983
and found to be two of the most massive particles~\cite{AUBERT1983275,1983398}. 
EWSB rescues what would be a collasal disagreement between theoretical prediction
and experimental results. The introduction of EWSB to the theory preserves the structure of
the electroweak interactions and succeedes in endowing the $\PW$ and $\PZ$ bosons
with mass.

Electroweak symmetry breaking is an application of spontaneous symmetry breaking to
the electroweak Lagrangian. It is achieved via the Brout--Englert--Higgs
mechanism~\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu,Higgs:1966ev,Kibble:1967sv},
leading, in its minimal version, to the prediction of the existence of one physical neutral scalar particle,
commonly known as the Higgs boson. The EWSB mechanism, defined by Brout, Englert, and Higgs,
proposes a self-interacting complex doublet scalar field,
\begin{equation}
\phi = \Bigg(\frac{\phi_{\alpha}}{\phi_{\beta}}\Bigg) = 
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \Bigg(\frac{\phi_{1} + i\phi_{1}}{\phi_{3} + i\phi_{4}}\Bigg),
\label{eqn:phi_doublet}
\end{equation}

that is applied to the electroweak Lagrangian, 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \big(D_{\mu}\phi\big)^{\dagger} \big(D^{\mu}\phi\big) - V\big(\phi\big),
\end{equation}

where $D^{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative and the potential, $V\big(\phi\big)$, 
is expressly defined with two terms, 
\begin{equation}
V\big(\phi\big) = \mu^{2}\phi^{\dagger}\phi + \lambda\big(\phi^{\dagger}\phi\big)^{2}
\label{eqn:v_pot}
\end{equation}

The Lagrangian describes a system of four scalar particles, the $\phi_{i}$,
of equation~\ref{eqn:phi_doublet} each with mass $\mu$. 
To achieve EWSB, the constants in the potential $V\big(\phi\big)$ are defined such that $\mu^{2} < 0$
and $\lambda > 0$. The choice $\mu^{2} < 0$ and $\lambda > 0$ lead to a potential $V\left(\phi\right)$
similar to what is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_potential}. Expanding around a choosen minima of the potential
$V\big(\phi\big)$, $v$, and taking $\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{4} = 0$ and
$\phi_{3}^{2} = -\frac{\mu^{2}}{\lambda} \equiv v^{2}$, $\phi$ becomes
\begin{equation}
\phi = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \Bigg(\frac{0}{v}\Bigg),
\label{eqn:phi_doublet_exp}
\end{equation}

where the scalar doublet, $\phi$ acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV), $v \approx 246\GeV$.
In this process a neutral and two charged massless Goldstone bosons~\cite{PhysRev.127.965} are generated. These Goldstone
bosons mix with the fields corresponding to the broken SU(2)$_{\text{L}} \,\times\,$ U(1)$_{\text{Y}}$
symmetries giving masses to the $\PW$ and $\PZ$ bosons. The single remaining component of the
original complex doublet $\phi$ becomes a new fundamental scalar particle 
known as the Higgs boson with a mass
\begin{equation}
\mH^{2} = 2\lambda v^2
\end{equation}

%Applying EWSB to the SM takes the symmetries expressed as 
%SU(3)$_{\text{C}} \,\times \,$ SU(2)$_{\text{L}} \,\times \,$ U(1)$_{\text{Y}}$ and turns them into
%SU(3)$_{\text{C}} \, \times \,$ U(1)$_{\text{em}}$.

\end{figure*}



\section{Higgs Yukawa Couplings}
In addition to providing a mechanism for the $\PW$ and $\PZ$ bosons to gain mass in the SM, EWSB also
provides a mechanism for the fermions to acquire mass through their interactions with the Higgs boson
via Yukawa couplings. A Yukawa coupling is an interaction between a scalar field and a Dirac field
similar to,
\begin{equation}
V \approx h_{f}\bar{\psi_{f}}\phi\psi_{f},
\end{equation}

where the Dirac fields, $\psi$, describe fermions and the scalar field, $\phi$, is taken to be that of the Higgs boson. 
The introduction of a Yukawa interaction linking together the fermions and the Higgs boson,
results in massive fermions where their mass can be written as,
\begin{equation}
m_{f} = \frac{h_{f} v}{\sqrt{2}}
\label{eqn:yukawa_c}
\end{equation}

which covers the masses for the nine charged fermions: the three charged leptons and six quarks.
The EWSB mechanism nor the Yukawa interaction provide insight into the larger variety of fermion
masses. Instead, the fermion masses are taken as free parameters of the SM and the values
$h_{f}$ represent the Yukawa coupling parameter for each of the fermions.

The mass of nine charged fermions are known experimentally, most to very high precision.
The $\Pgt$ lepton is known to be $1776.82\pm0.16\MeV$~\cite{PDG}.
Knowing this, the $\Pgt$ lepton to Higgs boson Yukawa coupling can be calculated from theory
and compared against experimental results. 

Exploring the Higgs boson to fermions decay process is the most promissing way to directly probe
the Higgs boson Yukawa couplings. The Higgs boson decay process are discussed below in 
Section~\ref{sec:higgs_decays} where this discussion continues.

%with equation~\ref{eqn:yukawa_c},
%\begin{equation}
%h_{\Pgt} = \frac{\sqrt{2} \, m_{\Pgt}}{v} = \sqrt{2}\frac{1.78\GeV}{246\GeV} = 0.0102
%\label{eqn:yukawa_tau}
%\end{equation}



\section{Higgs Production}
The Higgs boson is produced through interactions with the particles it couples to in the SM
Lagrangian. Understanding the different production mechanisms for the Higgs boson
allows experimentalists to search for unique signatures in collisions to better
help separate Higgs bosons from the myriad other interactions occuring in collisions at the LHC.
At a hadron collider like the LHC, the Higgs boson production
mechanisms begin from initial states of quarks and gluons. The Higgs boson
only couples to massive particles eliminating direct gluon to Higgs boson processes
as is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sm_forces} from the introduction.
However, the Higgs boson production process at the LHC which occures most often
begins with two gluons in the initial state, is called gluon fusion, and is discussed below.

Feynman diagrams of the leading Higgs boson production processes for
proton-proton based colliders, like the LHC, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_feyn}. 
The cross sections for the leading Higgs boson production processes
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_production}. The values for the leading
processes are approximately: gluon fusion ($ggH$) $\approx 49\pb$, 
vector boson fusion (VBF) $\approx 3.8\pb$, $\PW$ boson associated production ($\PW\PH$) $\approx 1.4\pb$,
and $\PZ$ boson associated production ($\PZ\PH$) $\approx 0.88\pb$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. 
The top-quark associated process ($\ttbar\PH$),
which is found to be relatively insignificant in the following analyses, has a cross
section approximatly half the size of the next smallest one, $\PZ\PH$, where
$\ttbar\PH \approx 0.51\pb$ and accounts for less than 1\% of the total Higgs boson
cross section.

\end{figure*}


\subsection{Gluon Fusion}
The Higgs boson does not couple directly to gluons. Thus, the $ggH$ process is mediated by 
a virtual top quark loop, Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_feyn}. There are contributions from the other lighter quarks; however,
their contribution in the loop is suppressed proportional to $m^{2}_{q}$.
Because of the relatively large mass of the top-quark, to a very good approximation, 
the leading top-quark contribution can be evaluated in the limit 
$m_{t} \to \inf$~\cite{ELLIS1976292,Shifman:1979eb}.

Despite the $ggH$ process having the largest cross section, it is the hardest process to 
isolate from background events. A portion of $ggH$ produced Higgs bosons are produced in
in conjunction with one or multiple ``jets''~\ref{sec:obj_reco_jets}. In these
cases the Higgs boson recoils off of the jet creating a boosted topology
which is a more unique event signature. In this thesis the boosted event topology
is used as a handle in the ``Boosted'' event selection category discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:htt_categorization}. The majority of $ggH$ events are produced without
additional jets. While not having as clear or a handel to separat these events from
the background, these events are kept and are categorized into the less sensative ``0-Jet'' category.


\subsection{Vector Boson Fusion}
The second largest Higgs boson production process is VBF. This process originates by
the scattering of two quarks or anti-quarks. The scattering is mediated by the t-
or u-channel exchange of a $\PW$ or $\PZ$ boson. The Higgs boson is radiated off
of the $\PW$ or $\PZ$ boson~\cite{PhysRevD.70.113009}, Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_feyn}. 
The quarks or anti-quarks which are scattered
lead to the generation of high-energy jets present in the Higgs boson event.
This is a highly unique event signature and is used in nearly all Higgs analyses
to identify Higgs bosons produced via VBF. In this thesis, events with two high-energy
jets consistent with VBF topology are categorized into a ``VBF'' category for analysis.


\subsection{Associated Production}
The Higgs boson associated production mechanism makes up the third and fourth largest
Higgs boson cross sections for $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ respctively. Both processes are 
depicted in the lower left Feynman diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_feyn} where
the $V$ represents vector bosons covering both $\PW$ and $\PZ$. Associated
production is often called Higgs-strahlung in reference to bremsstrahlung, the
process where a deccelerating charged particle emits radiation, often an electron
emitting a photon. In the case of Higgs-strahlung, the vector boson created 
from two initial state quarks or anti-quarks emits a Higgs boson. The associated
production event topology is quite unique with the presence of a $\PW$ or $\PZ$
boson plus a Higgs boson. In this thesis there is an analysis targeted at each
of these process, $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$.



\section{Higgs Decays}
\label{sec:higgs_decays}
After a Higgs boson is produced, it will decay extremly rapidly. The theorized lifetime of a Higgs
boson particle is $1.6 \times 10^{-22}$ s~\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}. This means that when created
inside of the CMS detector, a Higgs boson will always decay
within the CMS detector. In all Higgs boson analyses, experimentalists search for the
signatures of the decay products in energy deposits in their detectors, not the Higgs
boson itself. There are multiple possible decay
paths each with its own branching ratio; the largest branching ratio
processes are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_decay}. The $\htt$ process has a branching
ratio of approximately 6.3\% with a relative theoretical uncertainty of 
$\pm5.7\%$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz} for $\mH = 125\GeV$. This places $\htt$ below $\PH\to\bbbar$, 
$\PH\to\PW\PW$, and $\PH\to\Pg\Pg$ in branching fraction.

\begin{figure*}[htbp]

     \caption{

     \label{fig:higgs_decay}
\end{figure*}

The leading Higgs boson decay processes each have certain advantages and disadvantages
to elucidating the properties of the Higgs boson. The dominant Higgs boson decay 
process, $\PH\to\bbbar$, comprises well over half of all Higgs boson decays yet suffers
from very large background processes making it difficult to distinguish Higgs bosons.
Additionally, the $m_{\bar{b}b}$ resolution is limited making the expected Higgs boson
signal a broad distribution ontop of a large background~\cite{PDG}.
The $\PH\to\PW\PW$ process has a large branching ratio which is reduced after requiring
$\PW\to\ell + \bar{\nu}$ where $\ell$ is a charged lepton. Additionally, the presence of neutrinos
in the final state decreases the Higgs boson mass resolution, $\approx 20\% \, \mH$~\cite{PDG}.
The $\PH\to\Pg\Pg$ is an extraordinairly difficult process to attempt to observe at a
hadron collider because the final state provides no helpful handles to disintangle it from
the dominant multijet backgrounds.

The $\htt$ process is the largest direct Higgs boson to leptons decay process.
This provides a unique opportunity to probe the Higgs boson Yukawa couplings to the leptons,
while both the $\PH\to\bbbar$ and $\htt$ processes can directly probe the Higgs boson
Yukawa couplings to fermions. Similar to the $\PH\to\PW\PW$ process, $\htt$ has neutrinos
in the final state making reconstructing the Higgs boson mass non-trivial.
The relative size of the backgrounds with event signatures similar to the Higgs boson
are much smaller for the $\htt$ process versus the $\PH\to\bbbar$ process. This is one
of the significant benefits of studying the Higgs boson through the $\htt$ process.

In this thesis, the various Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions 
for Higgs boson production, and their corresponding uncertainties are taken from 
References~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz,Denner:2011mq,Ball:2011mu} and references therein.
