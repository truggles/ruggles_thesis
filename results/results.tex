\chapter{Combined $\htt$ Results}
\label{sec:cmb_results}

The previous two Chapters, ~\ref{sec:htt_analysis} and ~\ref{sec:vh_analysis}, discussed
analyses targeted at specific Higgs boson production mechanisms. In this chapter
I present results combining the 
$ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis~\cite{cms_13TeV_htt_jhep_2017}
with the $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ associated production targeted analysis~\cite{HIG-18-007}.
By combining these two $\htt$ analyses we have signal regions targeting the leading Higgs 
boson production processes: $ggH$, VBF, and $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ associated production. 
Combining the results, signal strengths, the $\htt$ significance and, Higgs
boson couplings can be probed with greater precision than either analysis alone.

Changes in the $ggH$ signal modeling and uncertainties were made between
publication of the $ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis~\cite{cms_13TeV_htt_jhep_2017} 
and the combination here to take advantage of the most accurate, available
simulations~\cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-17-031}.
The $ggH$ and VBF results presented in Chapters~\ref{sec:htt_analysis} uses $ggH$ simulated with NLO 
accuracy (Chapter~\ref{sec:simulation}). In this combination, 
the NLO $ggH$ samples were reweighted using the \textsc{NNLOPS} generator which is accurate at
the next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling~\cite{Hamilton2013}.
The reweighting matches the Higgs boson
$\pt$ spectrum and the quantity of jets from the hard-scattering process between these generators
and is defined to preserve the normalization
of the inclusive $ggH$, $\htt$ simulated process~\cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-17-031}. 
Additionally, the
$ggH$ cross section uncertainty scheme has been updated to align 
with the one proposed in Reference~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.
This uncertainty scheme includes 9 nuisance parameters accounting for uncertainties in the cross 
section prediction for exclusive jet bins, the 2 jet and 3 jet VBF phase spaces, different Higgs boson $\pt$ 
regions, and the uncertainty in the Higgs boson $\pt$ distribution due to missing higher order finite 
top quark mass corrections.


\section{Signal Strength and Significance}
The best fit signal strength ($\mu$) and significance can be computed for the combination and
leads to a decrease in the relative uncertainty on $\mu$ and an increase
in significance. The $\mu$ and significance
for each analysis and the combined values are presented in Table~\ref{tab:cmb_mu_and_sig}.
The slight excess in signal strength for the associated production analysis is tempered
when combined with the $ggH$ and VBF analysis, resulting in a $\mu$ fully consistent 
with the SM. The combination leads to an 
observed significance of 5.5 standard deviations (4.8 expected), surpassing the threshold for a
purely 13\TeV based CMS observation of the $\htt$ process.

The signal strength can be decomposed into the four leading Higgs boson production 
mechanisms. Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_mu_higgs_processes} shows this decomposition for
the combined results.

\section{Higgs Boson Couplings}
The Higgs boson couplings to different particles can be measured in different
ways. In this thesis the couplings are split into two groups, couplings to
fermions ($\kappa_\text{f}$) and couplings to vector bosons ($\kappa_\text{V}$) 
and are measured using couplings on both the production and decay processes. 
$\kappa_\text{V}$ and $\kappa_\text{f}$ quantify
the ratio between the measured and the SM value for the couplings of the Higgs boson
using the methods described in Reference~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}.

The $\htt$ decay process
provides direct access to the Higgs boson fermion couplings. While all
$\htt$ events provide access to fermionic couplings on the decay side,
the different production mechanisms provide access to different couplings on that side.
The $ggH$ process provides indirect access to fermionic couplings through
the top-quark loop. The VBF and associated production processes provide access to the
vector boson couplings via Higgs boson production.
The same combination of the dedicated $ggH$ and VBF analysis, including
the updates to the $ggH$ modeling, with
the dedicated $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ analysis can place the tightest
$\htt$ analysis limits in the $(\kappa_\text{V}$,$\kappa_\text{f})$ parameter space
because there is simultaneous access to processes which can constrain both
couplings.

To measure the couplings, a likelihood scan is performed for $\mH=125.09\GeV$ in 
the ($\kappa_\text{V}$,$\kappa_\text{f}$) parameter space.
For this scan only, Higgs boson decays to pairs of $\PW$ or $\PZ$ bosons, $\hww$ or $\hzz$,
are considered as part of the signal. They both contributed to $\kappa_\text{V}$ on the
decay side and are treated accordingly based on their production processes.
%The $\ttbar\PH$ production process is still treated as background because
%the MC sample we use is not split by Higgs boson decay mode. 
All nuisance 
parameters are profiled for each point of the scan. As shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_kFkV}, the observed likelihood contour is consistent with the SM expectation 
of $\kappa_\text{V}$ and $\kappa_\text{f}$ both equal to unity showing
agreement with the SM Higgs boson couplings to fermions and vector bosons.

 log-likelihood difference as a function of $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_f$, for

 This scan is a combination of the $ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis with the 
 $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ targeted analysis. For reference, the results for just
 the $ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis are also presented and correspond
 to the updated $ggH$ modeling.
 For this scan, all $\hww$ and $\hzz$ processes
