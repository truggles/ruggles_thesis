\chapter{Combined $\htt$ Results}
\label{sec:cmb_results}

The previous two Chapters, ~\ref{sec:htt_analysis} and ~\ref{sec:vh_analysis}, discussed
analyses targeted at specific Higgs boson production mechanisms. In this chapter
I present results from combining the previously mentioned 
$ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis~\cite{cms_13TeV_htt_jhep_2017}
with the $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ associated production targeted analysis~\cite{HIG-18-007}.
By combining these two $\htt$ analyses we have signal regions targeting the four leading Higgs 
boson production processes: $ggH$, VBF, and $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ associated production. 
By combining the results, signal strengths, significance and, Higgs
boson couplings can be probed with greater precision than either analysis alone.

\section{Signal Strength and Significance}
The best fit signal strength ($\mu$) and significance can be computed for the combination and
result in a decrease in the relative uncertainty on $\mu$ and an increase
in significance. The $\mu$ and significance
for each analysis and the combined values are presented in Table~\ref{tab:cmb_mu_and_sig}.
The slight excess in signal strength for the associated production analysis is tempered
when combined with the $ggH$ and VBF analysis, resulting in a $\mu$ fully consistent 
with the SM. The combination leads to an 
observed significance of 5.5 standard deviations, surpassing the threshold for a
purely 13\TeV based CMS observation of the $\htt$ process.

The signal strength can be decomposed by the four leading Higgs boson production 
mechanisms. Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_mu_higgs_processes} shows this decomposition for
the combined results.

 The constraints from the combined global fit are used to extract each of the 
 individual best fit signal strengths. The combined best fit signal strength 
 is $\mu = 1.24 ^{+0.29} _{-0.27}$.

\section{Higgs Boson Couplings}
The Higgs boson couplings to different particles can be measured in different
ways. In this thesis the couplings are decomposed into two groups, couplings to
fermions ($\kappa_\text{f}$) and couplings to vector bosons ($\kappa_\text{V}$) 
and are measured using couplings on both the production and decay processes. 
$\kappa_\text{V}$ and $\kappa_\text{f}$ quantify
the ratio between the measured and the SM value for the couplings of the Higgs boson
using the methods described in Reference~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}.

The $\htt$ decay process
provides direct access to the Higgs boson fermion couplings. While all
$\htt$ events provide access to fermionic couplings on the decay side,
the differenct production mechanisms provide access to different couplings on that side.
The $ggH$ process provides indirect access to fermionic couplings through
the top-quark loop. The VBF and $\PW\PH$ 
and $\PZ\PH$ associated production processes provide access to the
vector boson couplings via Higgs boson production.
The same combination of the dedicated $ggH$ and VBF analysis with 
the dedicated $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ analysis can place the tightest
$\htt$ analysis limits in the $(\kappa_\text{V}$,$\kappa_\text{f})$ parameter space
because there is simultaneous access to processes which can constrain both
couplings.

To measure the couplings, a likelihood scan is performed for $\mH=125.09\GeV$ in 
the ($\kappa_\text{V}$,$\kappa_\text{f}$) parameter space.
For this scan only, Higgs boson decays to pairs of $\PW$ or $\PZ$ bosons, $\hww$ or $\hzz$,
are considered as part of the signal. They both contributed to $\kappa_\text{V}$ on the
decay side and are treated accordingly based on their production processes.
%The $\ttbar\PH$ production process is still treated as background because
%the MC sample we use is not split by Higgs boson decay mode. 
All nuisance 
parameters are profiled for each point of the scan. As shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_kFkV}, the observed likelihood contour is consistent with the SM expectation 
of $\kappa_\text{V}$ and $\kappa_\text{f}$ both equal to unity showing
agreement with the SM Higgs boson couplings to fermions and vector bosons.

 log-likelihood difference as a function of $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_f$, for 
 $\mH = 125.09$\GeV.  All nuisance parameters are profiled for each point. 
 This scan is a combination of the $ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis with the 
 $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ targeted analysis. For reference the results for just
 the $ggH$ and VBF targeted analysis are presented as ``HIG-16-043''.
 For this scan, the $\hww$ and $\hzz$ processes 
 are treated as signal.
