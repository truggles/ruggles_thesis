\chapter{Higgs $\to \tau\tau$: Analysis Strategy}
\label{sec:htt_analysis}

This chapter describes a study of Higgs Boson production and subsequent
decay to a pair of $\tau$ leptons using CMS proton-proton collision data gathered in 2016. This is the first
$\htt$ analysis performed using center-of-mass energy 13 TeV data from the LHC. Combining
these 13 TeV results with 7 TeV and 8 TeV CMS $\htt$ results we produce
the first single experiment observation of the $\htt$ process, observed at the 5.9 $\sigma$
confidence level. Additionally, this study provides the strongest constraints on VBF Higgs 
production to date for all CMS Higgs Boson analyses.

\section{Overview: Higgs $\to \tau\tau$}

This chapter specifically focuses on studying the Higgs Boson produced via the gluon fusion
or the VBF production mechanisms. A study of the Higgs Boson produced in associated production with
$\PW/\PZ$ is presented in the following chapter~\ref{sec:vh_analysis}. This study utilizes the
full 2016 $\pp$ dataset collected by CMS corresponding to 35.9$\fbinv$ of integrated luminosity.
In the following pages the symbol $\ell$ refers to electrons and muons and $\tauh$ refers to hadronically
decaying $\tau$ leptons. We study all possible $\tau\tau$ final state combinations with the
exception of two electron and two muon final states because of the low 
$\tau\tau \to \tau_{e}\tau_{e}/\tau_{\mu}\tau_{\mu}$
branching fractions and high background from $\PZ \to ee/\mu\mu$. The $\htt$ final states which are
studied are: $\tau_{e}\tauh$ denoted here as $\Pe\tauh$, $\tau_{\mu}\tauh$ denoted as $\Pgm\tauh$,
$\tau_{e}\tau_{\mu}$ denoted here as $\Pe\Pgm$, and lastly, $\tauh\tauh$ denoted as $\tauh\tauh$.
This combination of final states covers about 94\% of all possible $\tau\tau$ final states.
The different $\tau\tau$ final states will be refered to as different channels in the following pages.
We ensure uniqueness between the four studied channels be applying veto criteria to events based
on the number of reconstructed loosely identified electrons and muons. This ensures that 
no data or simulated event is double counted in two channels.

Selected events are classified into three different categories targeting different characteristics
of the gluon fusion and VBF production topologies. The categories are defined according to the
number and kinematics of the associated jets in each event along with the reconstructed $\pt^{Higgs}$.
A number of different control regions are used in the final fit for signal extraction. This allows
the fit to simultaneously adjust and constrain all processes targeted by a control region. This is in
contrast to extracting a scale factor which is applied as a fixed value in an analysis which is not
allowed to adjust as other background process adjust in the final fit. The backgrounds which are
targeted with dedicated control regions are: $\PW$+jets, QCD multijet, and $\ttbar$.



\subsection{Event Selection}

There are specific baseline criteria applied to all electrons, muons, $\tauh$, and jets for every
event. Depending on the final state, additional requirements are placed on these objects based
on suppressing target backgrounds or to meet trigger requirements and analysis optimization. The baseline criteria ensure
that each object is well reconstructed and well identified and consistent with the analysis
strategy. 

\subsection{Triggers}
Selected events are required to to have fired a high level trigger consisten with their categorized final
state channel. For the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel, events are selected using a combination
of a single isolationed muon trigger as well as a cross trigger firing on an isolated muon and
an isolated $\tauh$. The $\Pgm\tauh$ cross trigger allows for a lower $\pt$ threshold
on the selected muon. In contrast, due to the HLT menu available in 2016, the $\Pe\tauh$ cross triggers
do not bring a substantial increase in acceptance and were not used in this analysis.
For the $\Pe\tauh$ channel, events are selected using only a trigger firing on a 
single isolated electron. For the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel, events are selected with electron-muon cross
triggers requiring an isolated online electron and an isolated online muon. There are two 
different electron-muon corss triggers used with their HLT $\pt$ thresholds detailed following.
For the $\tauh\tauh$ channel, events are selected using an online criteria of two loosely isolated $\tauh$. 
The HLT paths used and their online $\pt$ thresholds are detailed in table~\ref{tab:htt_hlt_triggers}.

Due to changing data gathering conditions and a changing HLT menu throughout 2016 data taking, the HLT path
requirements changed throughout 2016 and are era dependant. During latter eras, at higher instantaneous 
luminsity, some HLT paths became diabled or prescaled. The study avoids using any prescaled
HLT paths. For the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel this 
leads to changes in the $\abs\eta$ requirement on the online muon in the single muon triggers.
There are two muon-tau cross triggers available throughout 2016. One of them requires only the
presence of a single muon at the Level-1 trigger and has ``SingleL1'' appended to its path
name. The other requires the presence of both a muon and a $\tauh$ at the Level-1 trigger.
The single electron trigger used in the $\Pe\tauh$ channel remained constant through the year.
Due to changing pileup conditions and increasing luminosity during the final eras, the online
isolation criteria was changed for the $\tauh\tauh$ channel triggers. The online $\tauh$ 
isolation changed from being based on purely charged energy deposits to being based on a 
combination of charged and neutral based energy deposits. The triggers used in the
$\Pe\Pgm$ channel changed during the final two eras, G and H, and had a lepton DZ filter
applied to them. The DZ filter requires that the electron and muon match to the HLT primary
vertex. This is a common method used to reduce rate at the HLT. In all channels, the electrons, muons, and
$\tauh$ in each event must be matched to within $\Delta R < 0.5$ with the associated
HLT object which triggered the event.

\subsection{Baseline Object Selection}
All electrons and muons must meet the minimum requirement
that the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex satisfies $\abs{d_z}<0.2$ cm
along the beam direction, and $\abs{d_{xy}}<0.045$ cm in the transverse plane. Ensuring
compatibility with the primary vertex is consistent with the predicted infinitesimal life-time of
a Higgs Boson. The HPS reconstruction of $\tauh$ detailed in section~\ref{sec:XXX} can involve
combining together multiple tracks and $\PGpz$s coming from intermediary $\tau$ decay products.
Due to these intermediary products, the reconstructed $d_{xy}$ for $\tauh$ are often
larger than those for electrons and muons. Because of this, the primary vertex matching
criteria are relaxed for $\tauh$ and only require $\abs{d_z}<0.2$ cm.

The offline selection criteria for all electrons, muons, and $\tauh$ are motivated and constrained
by the High Level Trigger requirements of their path. Specifically, the offline $\pt$ criteria
applied are always higher than the HLT $\pt$ threshold to ensure a stable measurement and application
of trigger efficiencies. An offline $\pt$ threshold applied right at the HLT $\pt$ threshold
makes measurement of the steeply rising efficiency at the HLT threshold absolutly critical.
This is very difficult to do perfectly and would lead to very large trigger systematics
at low $\pt$ in the turn-on region. Additionally, there are offline $\eta$ restrictions
enforced which align with those at the HLT.

All selected electrons, muons, and $\tauh$ must be well identified and isolated from overlapping
energy deposits and reconstructed objects. This study uses identification criteria
provided centrally by the CMS Physics Object Groups (POGs). All identification and isolation
working points used have been selected through an optimization process selecting
for increased analysis sensitivity. The optimimum working points strike a balance
between signal efficiency and background rejection. For electrons an MVA-based ID
is used in both the $\Pe\tauh$ and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels which has been tuned to provide 
80\% electron selection efficiency. Muons in both the $\mu\tauh$ and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels
require the Particle Flow Medium ID. The selection of $\tauh$ relies on MVA-based working
points. The $\tauh$ MVA-based working points combine both object identification and object
isolation together into a single set of working points. Table~\ref{tab:htt_obj_selection}
details the $\pt$, $\abs\eta$, identification and isolation criteria for all electrons, muons,
and $\tauh$ selected in the study.

The three different signal extraction categories rely on the details of reconstructed jets, or
lack there of, in each event.  Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\text{T}}$ algorithm with distance
parameter $\Delta\text{R}=0.4$~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp}.  Charged hardons that are not consistent with
the primary vertex are removed from the anti-$k_{\text{T}}$ clustering.  Jets are only considered
if they pass they pass the loose working point of the PF Jet ID discriminator~\cite{jetID}.
Jets must have $\pt > 30 \GeV$ and $\abs\eta<4.7$.  The $\pt$ and $\eta$ requirements are altered
for cases where the jet is identified as having likely originated from a b-quark.  Jets likey originating
from a b-quark are considered if they pass the CISVv2 Medium working point are then labeled as b-tagged jets.
B-tagged jets have a relaxed $\pt$ requirement but much tighter $\eta$ requirement: $\pt > 20 \GeV$ 
and $\abs\eta<2.4$.  The tightened $\eta$ requirment necessitates that b-tagged jets are located within
the detector volumne fully covered by the CMS pixel and strip tracker.
Lastly, all jets must be separated from the selected electrons, muons, and $\tauh$ by $\Delta\text{R}>0.5$.

Depending on the di-$\tauh$ channel, there are specific topological cuts targeted at significantly
reducing the contribution of certain background processes in the signal region.  The large $\PW+\text{jets}$
cross section combined with a non-negligible jet $\to \tauh$ fake rate leads to a large $\PW+\text{jets}$
contribution in the $\ell\tauh$ channels.  This contribution is significantly reduced at the cost of
minimal signal events by cutting on the transverse mass, $\MT$.  Where the $\MT$ selection is defined as,

\begin{equation}
\MT \equiv \sqrt{\smash[b]{2 \pt^\ell \ptmiss [1-\cos(\Delta\phi)]}} < 50\GeV,
\end{equation}

where $\pt^\ell$ is the transverse momentum of the lepton $\ell$,
and $\Delta\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between its direction and the \etvecmiss.

In the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel, the large \ttbar background is reduced by requiring 
$p_\zeta - 0.85 \, p_\zeta^{\text{vis}} > -35$ or $-10$\GeV depending on which category the event is
classified within.  $p_\zeta$ is the component of the \etvecmiss projected along the bisector 
of the transverse momenta of the two leptons and $p_\zeta^{\text{vis}}$ is the sum of the components 
of the lepton transverse momenta along the same direction~\cite{Khachatryan:2014wca}, also see
figure~\ref{fig:htt_pZeta} for visual reference.
The $p_\zeta$ selection criteria has a high signal efficiency. The \etvecmiss is typically oriented
in the same direction as the visible di-$\Pgt$ system in signal events because the \etvecmiss is 
the results of neutrinos from the signal $\tau$s.  The orientation of the \etvecmiss with respect
to the di-$\tau$ system is much less predictable in \ttbar events.  In addition, events with a b-tagged 
jet are discarded to further suppress the \ttbar background in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Categorization}

Selected events are split into three mutually exclusive categories per decay channel.
The categories are designed to target different aspects of the gluon fusion and VBF Higgs Boson production mechanisms.
In each category the two variables that maximize the $\PH\to\Pgt\Pgt$ sensitivity are chosen to build 
two-dimensional (2D) distributions.

The three categories are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item {0-jet}: This category targets Higgs Boson events produced via gluon fusion.
The two variables chosen to extract the results are $\mvis$ and
the reconstructed $\tauh$ decay mode in the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ decay channels.
In the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel, $\mvis$ and the $\pt$ of the muon are used. The $\PZ\to\ell\ell$ background 
is large in the 1-prong and 1-prong + $\PGpz$(s) $\tauh$ decay modes in the
$\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels. By using only $\mvis$ instead of $\mtt$ the \etvecmiss
does not smear the mass reconstruction for $\PZ\to\ell\ell$ which retains a nice sharp peak.
The sharp Z peak of $\PZ\to\ell\ell$ provides 
an excellent handel to distinguish $\PZ\to\ell\ell$ from the other background process and
helps constrain the associated uncertainties for electrons and muons faking $\tauh$.
As electrons and muons almost exclusively fake 1-prong and 1-prong + $\PGpz$(s) $\tauh$,
the reconstructed $\tauh$ decay mode is used as the second of the 2D variables in the
$\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels. Additionally, the lack of $\PZ\to\ell\ell$ in the
3-prong decay mode results in increased signal significance for that region.
Examples of the 2D distributions for the signal and $\PZ\to\ell\ell$ background
in the 0-jet category of the $\Pgm\tauh$ decay channel are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:htt_2Dcategories} (top).
In the $\tauh\tauh$ decay channel, only one observable, $\mtt$, is considered because of the low
event yields due to the relatively high $\pt$ thresholds on the $\tauh$ at trigger level, and 
because of the sharply falling $\tauh$ $\pt$ distribution. Simulations indicate that about 98\% 
of signal events in the 0-jet category correspond to Higgs Bosons produced via the gluon 
fusion production mechanism.

\item {VBF}: This category targets Higgs boson events produced via the VBF process.
The presence of jets from the hard scattering process in VBF production leads the study to heavily
utilize jet kinematics and the jet topology in the VBF category.
Events are selected with at least two (exactly two) jets with $\pt>30$\GeV in the
$\tauh\tauh$, $\Pgm\tauh$, and $\Pe\tauh$ ($\Pe\Pgm$) channels.
In the $\Pgm\tauh$, $\Pe\tauh$, and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels, the two leading jets are required to have 
an invariant mass, $\mjj$, larger than 300\GeV. The variable $\pth$, defined as the magnitude 
of the vectorial sum of the $\ptvec$ of the visible decay products of the $\Pgt$ leptons 
and $\etvecmiss$, is required to be greater than 50 (100)\GeV in the $\Pgm\tauh$
 and $\Pe\tauh$ ($\tauh\tauh$) channels to reduce the contribution from $\PW+\text{jets}$ 
backgrounds. This selection criterion also suppresses the background from quantum 
chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events. In addition, the $\pt$ threshold on the $\tauh$ 
candidate is raised to 40\GeV in the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel. The two leading jets in the 
$\tauh\tauh$ channel should be separated in pseudorapidity by $\Delta\eta>2.5$. The $\Delta\eta>2.5$
cut in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel significantly reduces the contributions from QCD multijet events at the cost
of very few signal events because of the large jet $\Delta\eta$ in genuine VBF events.
The two observables used in the VBF category are $\mtt$ and $\mjj$ for all channels. Example 2D 
distributions for the signal and $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ background
in the VBF category of the $\Pgm\tauh$ decay channel are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:htt_2Dcategories} (center). 
Integrating over the whole $\mjj$ phase space, up to 57\% of the signal events in the VBF 
category are produced in the VBF production mode, but this proportion increases with $\mjj$ allowing
for signal production process discrimination in the highest $\mjj$ ranges.

\item {Boosted}: This category contains all selected events that do not enter one of the previous 
categories, namely events with one jet and events with several jets that fail the specific requirements of the VBF category.
The Boosted category contains a mix of gluon fusion events produced in association with one or more jets (78--80\% of signal events),
VBF events where one of the jets escaped detection or has low $\mjj$ (11--13\%), as well as
Higgs Bosons produced in association with a $\PW$ or a $\PZ$ boson decaying hadronically (4--8\%).
Because these gluon fusion events failed the 0-jet category, the Higgs Boson will be recoiling 
off of one or more jets making the $\pth$ a natural choice for the second distribution variable with
$\mtt$ as the other of the 2D variables. 
Most background processes, including $\PW+\text{jets}$ and QCD multijet events, typically have low $\pth$. 
Example 2D distributions for the signal and $\PW+\text{jets}$ background in the Boosted category of 
the $\Pgm\tauh$ decay channel are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:htt_2Dcategories} (bottom).
\end{itemize}

In figure~\ref{fig:htt_2Dcategories}, the background processes are chosen for illustrative 
purpose for their separation from 
the signal. The $\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ background in the 0-jet category is concentrated in 
the regions where the visible mass is close to 90\GeV and is negligible when the $\tauh$ 
candidate is reconstructed in the 3-prong decay mode. The $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ background in 
the VBF category mostly lies at low $\mjj$ values whereas the distribution of VBF signal 
events extends to high $\mjj$ values. In the Boosted category, the W+jets background, 
which behaves similarly to the QCD multijet background, is rather flat with respect to $\mtt$, and 
is concentrated at low $\pth$ values.

The three categories and the variables used to build the 2D distributions are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:htt_categories}.

The results of the analysis are extracted with a global maximum likelihood fit based on the 
2D distributions in the various signal regions, and on the control regions, detailed in 
Section~\ref{sec:background_estimation}, that constrain the normalizations of the main backgrounds.

\section{Data Set}
The $\htt$ study utilizes the full 2016 $\pp$ dataset collected by CMS corresponding to 35.9$\fbinv$ 
of integrated luminosity.  The data were gathered at center-of-mass energy 13 TeV.
As data are gathered at CMS, the conditions of the CMS experiment and its subdetectors are recorded.
The CMS experiment uses an offline validation process to ensure that only high quality
data is used in future analyses.  Data collected while the CMS detector is in a faulty state
is flagged as such and, when an analyst processes the data, the faulty data is skipped.
When only considering the data considered good and usable for physics, the CMS experiment
gathered 35.9$\fbinv$ of integrated lumiosity in 2016.

In this analysis only a subset of the total data marked as good is used.  During data
gathering, data is filtered into primary datasets (PDs) corresponding to which HLT trigger
made the determination to save a given event.  The HLT triggers using in this analysis,
detailed in table~\ref{tab:htt_hlt_triggers}, correspond to: the Single Electron/Photon
PD, the Single Muon PD, the Muon and Electron PD, and the Tau PD.



\section{Monte Carlo Samples}
Signal and background processes are modeled with samples of simulated events.
For details on the production for simulated events, see section~\ref{sec:simulation}.

The signal samples with a Higgs Boson produced vai the gluon fusion production
mechanism ($\cPg\cPg\PH$), vector boson fusion (VBF), or in association with a $\PW$ or $\PZ$ boson ($\PW\PH$ or $\PZ\PH$), 
are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) 
with the \POWHEG 2.0~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw, Alioli:2010xd, Alioli:2010xa, Alioli:2008tz} 
generator. For the $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ simulated samples, the \textsc{minlo hvJ}~\cite{Luisoni:2013kna} 
extension of \POWHEG 2.0 is used. The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) used for all
simulated samples is NNPDF30\_nlo\_as\_0118~\cite{Ball:2011uy}. It is found that the $\ttbar\PH$ 
process is negligible in comparison with the other signal processes and is therefor excluded.
Mass dependant production cross sections and $\htt$ branching fractions for the SM Higgs Boson production, 
and their corresponding uncertainties are taken from 
Refs.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz,Denner:2011mq,Ball:2011mu} and references therein.

The $\text{MG5}_\aMCATNLO$~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} generator is used for $\PZ+$jets and $\PW+$jets processes. 
They are simulated at leading order (LO) with MLM jet matching and merging~\cite{Alwall:2007fs}.
The \aMCATNLO generator is also used for diboson production simulated at next-to-LO (NLO) with the 
FxFx jet matching and merging~\cite{Frederix:2012ps}. In contrast, \POWHEG 2.0 and 1.0 are used for \ttbar
and single top quark production, respectively. The generators are interfaced with \PYTHIA 
8.212 ~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} to model the parton showering and fragmentation, as well as 
the decay of the $\Pgt$ leptons. The \PYTHIA parameters affecting the description of the 
underlying event are set to the {CUETP8M1} tune~\cite{Khachatryan:2015pea}.

For each simulated event, a number of additional pileup interactions is simulated and added. 
The number of pileup interactions added is based on best efforts to match the simulated
events to the pileup in data which is estimated from the measured instantaneous
luminosity for each bunch crossing. The average number of additional pileup interactions in
the 2016 CMS data is approximately 27 interactions per bunch crossing.


\section{SVFit Algorithm}
FIXME -- need to edit this part
The visible mass of the $\Pgt\Pgt$ system, $\mvis$, can be used to separate
the $\PH\to \Pgt \Pgt$ signal events
from the large contribution of irreducible $\PZ \to \Pgt \Pgt$ events.
However, the neutrinos from the $\Pgt$ lepton decays carry a large fraction of
the $\Pgt$ lepton energy and reduce the discriminating power of this variable.
The \textsc{svfit} algorithm combines the \etvecmiss with the four-vectors of both $\Pgt$ candidates
to calculate a more accurate estimate of the mass of the parent boson, denoted as $\mtt$. The resolution of $\mtt$ is between 15 and 20\% depending on the $\Pgt\Pgt$ final state.
A detailed description of the algorithm can be found
in Ref.~\cite{Bianchini:2014vza}. Both variables are used in the analysis, as detailed in Section.~\ref{sec:categories}, and $\mvis$ is preferred over $\mtt$ when the background from $\PZ \to \ell\ell$ events is large.


\section{Background Estimation}
\label{sec:background_estimation}
\subsubsection{Drell--Yan Background}
The largest irreducible source of background is the Drell--Yan production
of $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgt\Pgt, \ell\ell$. Proper shape and normalization for this
leading background is critical to the success of the analysis.
A dedicated, high purity, $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$ control region was
used to measure reweighting factors for application to all Drell--Yan
simulated events and is detailed in the Monte Carlo Corrections 
section~\ref{sec:htt_dy_reweighting}.

\subsubsection{$\PW+\text{jets}$ Background}
The $\PW+\text{jets}$ process is modelled using simulation.
In the $\tauh\tauh$ and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels the $\PW+\text{jets}$ contribution 
is small compared to other backgrounds. In these two channels both the shape and 
yield are taken from simulation.
The background from $\PW+\text{jets}$ production contributes significantly to the
$\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels, when the $\PW$ boson decays leptonically and
a jet is misidentified as a $\tauh$ candidate. In the $\ell\tauh$ channels
the shape of the background is from simulation. The yield is estimated 
using data in a $\PW+\text{jets}$ enriched dedicated side-band region defined
based on a transverse mass cut, $\MT > 80\GeV$. In this high-$\MT$ side-band region, the $\PW+\text{jets}$
process is scaled so that the sum total of expected background events is equivalent
to the sum total of observed data events. The scaling factor is then applied
in the low transverse mass signal regions, $\MT < 50\GeV$. A scaling factor
is measured for the 0-jet and Boosted categories for both $\Pe\Pgt$ and $\Pgm\Pgt$ resulting
in four $\PW+\text{jets}$ scaling values. The scaling factor measured in the Boosted
category is extrapolated to the VBF category. The $\PW+\text{jets}$ purity in these
side-band regions varies from about 50\% in the Boosted category to 85\% in the 0-jet category.

The high-$\MT$ side-bands, described above, are included as control regions in the final fit.
These high-$\MT$ $\PW+\text{jets}$ control regions can be seed in Figure~\ref{fig:htt_wj_CR1}.
The control regions are only a singular bin because they are used solely to constrain 
the normalization of the $\PW+\text{jets}$ process.

the global fit. These regions, defined with $\MT>80$\GeV, control the yields of the 
$\PW+\text{jets}$ background in the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels.  
}
     \label{fig:htt_wj_CR1}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{QCD Multijet Background}
The QCD multijet process constitutes an important source of reducible background 
in the $\tauh\tauh$ and $\ell\tauh$ channels. The QCD multijet process is subdominant
in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel. For all four channels, the QCD multijet, is estimated from data.  
Side-band control regions are constructed to estimate the shape and the yield of the QCD multijet 
background in these channels.

QCD multijet estimation for the $\ell\tauh$ channels follows:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Raw yield is extracted using a sample where the
$\ell$ and the $\tauh$ candidates have the same-sign charge. Using this sample, the QCD multijet 
process is estimated from data by subtracting the contribution of the Drell--Yan, \ttbar, diboson,
and $\PW+\text{jets}$ processes as in equation~\ref{eqn:qcd_eqn}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:qcd_eqn}
\text{QCD} = \text{Data} - \text{Other Background Processes}
\end{equation}

\item The 2D distributions of the QCD multijet background are estimated from a region with 
same-sign leptons, same as the yield estimate, except the isolation of the $\ell$ and $\tauh$ 
candidates is additionally relaxed to reduce the statistical fluctuations in the distributions. 
The contributions from other background process are subtracted from data, equation~\ref{eqn:qcd_eqn},
to extract the QCD multijet shape template in this region.

\item The raw yield obtained above is corrected to account for observed differences between the background 
composition in the same-sign and opposite-sign regions. An extrapolation factor between the same-sign 
and opposite-sign regions is determined by comparing the yield of the estimated QCD multijet background for 
events with $\ell$ candidates passing inverted isolation criteria, in the same-sign and opposite-sign 
regions. This extrapolation factor is allowed to adjust in the final fit via the inclusion of dedicated QCD
multijet control regions for these channels.
%Figure~\ref{fig:htt_qcd_CR3} shows these control regions for the 0-jet and Boosted categories 
%of the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels; the observable is $\mvis$ or $\mtt$ to provide 
%discrimination between the QCD multijet and the $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ processes.
\end{enumerate}

The same technique is used in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel, except no control region is included in the 
fit because QCD multijet events contribute little to the total background in this decay channel.

%yields of the QCD multijet background in the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels.  The constraints obtained in the Boosted categories are propagated to the VBF categories of the corresponding channels.}
%     \label{fig:htt_qcd_CR3}
%\end{figure*}

In the $\tauh\tauh$ channel, the large QCD multijet background is estimated differently than
the other channels. Instead of deriving the QCD multijet shape template from the same-sign
region, the template is instead derived from the opposite-sign region using 
equation~\ref{eqn:qcd_eqn}. The reason for this is that the shape of the QCD multijet
distributions are difference between the same-sign and opposite-sign regions in the
$\tauh\tauh$ channel. The difference in these shape templates is statistically
evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. The KS test is a nonparametric test of the compatibility
of continuous, one-dimensional probability distributions. Specifically, this study relied
on a two sample, binned KS test which tested the compatibility of the QCD multijet
estimated background in the same-sign region with that estimated in the opposite-sign region.
The results of these compatibility tests are summarized in table~\ref{tab:htt_qcd_ks}.
Beyond showing the incompatibility of same-sign and opposite-sign shapes, different
isolation requirements were used to test the compatibility of QCD multijet shapes
across different isolation ranges for i) the same-sign events, and ii) again for the
opposite-sign events. These tests showed a much higher degree of shape compatibility
for events with different isolation requirements, but the same charge configuraion.
Because of this, a relaxed isolation criteria is used to derive the QCD multijet
template for the $\tauh\tauh$ channel.

}
\label{tab:htt_qcd_ks}
\end{table} 

The selection used to estimate the QCD multijet background shape template and raw yield requires 
that at least one of the $\tauh$
must fail the \texttt{Tight Tau MVA} requirement which is the isolation selection used to 
define the signal region. This selection
ensures that the side-band sample is disjoin from the signal region.
In this region, the QCD multijet background shape and raw yield are obtained
by subtracting the contribution of the Drell--Yan, \ttbar, and $\PW+\text{jets}$ processes
from the data as in equation~\ref{eqn:qcd_eqn}.
A schematic representation of the $\tauh\tauh$ signal region and QCD multijet relaxed
isolation estimation region is in figure~\ref{fig:htt_tautau_qcd_schematic1}.

does not overlap with the signal region.
     }
     \label{fig:htt_tautau_qcd_schematic1}
\end{figure*}

A scaling factor is required to adjust the raw yield estimated in the relaxed isolation region to the expected
QCD multijet yield in the signal extraction region. This extrapolation factor
is estimated in the same-sign charge region. Two same-sign QCD multijet samples are constructed
using 1) the exact same isolation requirements as the signal region; all selections are identical
here except for the $\tauh$ charge configuration. And, 2) a second region with the exact 
same relaxed isolation requirements as the region used to estimate the opposite-sign
QCD multijet shape template and raw yield. From these two samples a ``Relaxed-Region-to-Signal-Region''
scaling factor is calculated as,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:htt_tt_qcd_sf}
\text{Relaxed-Region-to-Signal-Region SF} = \frac{\text{SS Signal Region Yield}}{\text{SS Relaxed Region Yield}}
\end{equation}
where (SS) is same-sign.
Multiplying the raw yield estimated above by this scaling factor results in the estimated
QCD multijet contribution in the signal region. The ``Relaxed-Region-to-Signal-Region'' scale factors
for the three $\tauh\tauh$ categories are listed in table~\ref{tab:htt_qcd_sf}. The uncertainties associated
with these scale factors are propagated through the QCD multijet estimation process and combined
with results from closure tests to estimate a final category dependant systematic and statistic uncertainty
for the QCD multijet estimation process.

The events selected with opposite-sign $\tauh$ candidates passing relaxed isolation requirements 
form control regions, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:htt_qcd_CR4}, and are used in the global fit to extract the results.

     \label{fig:htt_qcd_CR4}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{\ttbar Background}
The \ttbar production process is one of the main backgrounds in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel.
In all channels \ttbar is predicted from simulation. The normalization is adjusted using
a \ttbar-enriched control region orthogonal to the signal region. This control region is included
in the global fit. The control region is defined from the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel and the yield
of \ttbar in all channels and categories is adjusted by this singular \ttbar control region.
It is shown in figure~\ref{fig:htt_ttbar_CR2},
Orthagonality from the $\Pe\Pgm$ signal region is achieved by inverting the $p_\zeta$ requirement
and the events should contain at least one jet.

\begin{figure}[htb]

     \includegraphics[width=0.23\textwidth]{higgs_to_taus/plots/Figure_005-a.pdf}

yields of the \ttbar background in all channels.}
     \label{fig:htt_ttbar_CR2}
\end{figure}

Other background processes, such as, contributions from diboson and single top quark production, are estimated 
from simulation.


\section{Monte Carlo Corrections}
\label{sec:mc_corrections}

Corrections are applied to the simulated Monte Carlo samples to help correct for measured differences
between observed data and expectations based on simulation. Many of these corrections are designed
to correct differences in reconstruction and identification efficiencies for objects between data
and simulation. These corrections are derived in
fully orthogonal regions from the analysis signal regions when ever possible. There are however a
number of
instances where the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel is used to derive corrections. In these cases the measurement
region used to derive corrections will overlap with a subset of the analysis signal regions. This
overlap is discussed in the Systematic Uncertainties section~\ref{sec:htt_systematics}.


\subsection{Pileup Reweighting}
During 2016 data taking, the LHC delivered \pp collisions to CMS with an average of approximately 27
interactions per bunch crossing. Monte Carlo samples are generated with additional pileup interactions
added to the hard-scattering process for each event. A reweighting technique is used which improves
the aligment between the pileup interactions in data and those in simulation. This is critical because
there are some reconstructed event characteristics such as \etvecmiss which have different performance
in resolution and response depending on the number of pileup interactions in an event.


\subsection{Tau Identification Efficiency}
\label{sec:htt_tau_id_eff}
The reconstruction efficiency for hadronically decaying taus is observed to be different in data and in simulated samples.
Correction factors are derived by the Tau POG in the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel using a tag-and-probe method. Essentially,
the Tau ID Efficiency measurement selects $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgt\Pgt\to\Pgm\tauh$ events on the $\PZ$
mass peak and performs a fit with the $\PZ\to\Pgm\tauh$ process treated as a signal. The degree
to which the $\PZ\to\Pgm\tauh$ process is scaled up to down is the resulting Tau ID Efficiency
scale factor. The measured scale factor is 0.95 $\pm$ 5\% for all $\tauh$ passing \texttt{Tight Tau MVA}.
This correction factor is applied to all simulated $\tauh$ which are matched at the generator
level to $\tau$ leptons.


\subsection{Tau Energy Correction}
\label{sec:htt_tec}
The energy of each simulated $\tauh$, which matches to a $\tau$ at the generator level, is corrected
to better represent the observed energy of $\tauh$ in data. The correction is measured and applied
as a function of $\tauh$ decay mode with each correction listed in table~\ref{tab:htt_tec}. The measurement
of this correction is performed in the $\Pgm\tauh$ final state by the Tau POG. The effect of
the shifted $\tauh$ energy is fully propagated through to the \etvecmiss for each event.

\begin{table*}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
$\tauh$ Decay Mode   &   Energy Correction   \\
\hline
1-prong            &   -1.8\%  $\pm$ 1.2\%  \\
1-prong+$\PGpz$    &   +1.0\%  $\pm$ 1.2\%  \\
3-prong            &   +0.4\%  $\pm$ 1.2\%  \\  
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:htt_tec}
\caption{
Energy corrections applied to simulated genuine $\tauh$. The energy corrections are measured
and applied depending on the reconstructed decay mode of the $\tauh$.
}
\end{table*}



\subsection{Lepton Identification and Isolation Efficiencies}
Similar to the Tau ID Efficiency measured above, the electron and muon reconstruction, identification,
and isolation efficiencies are measured in both data and simulation. Correction factors equal to
$\epsilon_{data}/\epsilon_{MC}$ are derived as a function of both lepton $\pt$ and lepton $\eta$.
The electron (muon) efficiencies are measured in $\PZ\to\Pe\Pe$ ($\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$) events using a tag-and-probe
method.


\subsection{Trigger Efficiencies}
\label{sec:htt_trigger_eff}
Trigger efficiencies are measured in data and in simulation for all of the channels. For the channels
which trigger on $\tauh$, the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\tauh\tauh$ channels, the $\tauh$ efficiency is measured
using tag-and-probe in the $\Pgm\tauh$ final state. The efficiencies for the $\tauh\tauh$ channel
are measured with dedicated muon+$\tauh$ monitoring triggers. The $\tauh$ trigger requirements
are identical between the monitoring trigger and the $\tauh\tauh$ trigger paths. The tag-and-probe
is conducted using the Single Muon PD. The selection for the $\tauh$ trigger efficiency measurements 
requires one well identified and isolated muon per event. The muon is required to fire a single muon trigger.
Events with at least one $\tauh$ which passes \texttt{decay mode finding} and \texttt{Tight Tau MVA} isolation
constitute the denominator selection for the efficiency measurement. Events where the $\tauh$
fires the trigger under study are recorded as passing events. The ratio of passing events to
denominator events defines the trigger efficiency. Trigger efficiencies are measured and applied as 
a function of $\tauh$: $\pt$, decay mode, and generator matching status. Figure~\ref{fig:htt_tt_trig}
shows the trigger efficiency versus $\pt$ for the double-$\tauh$ trigger.

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]

     \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{higgs_to_taus/plots/htt_tautau_trigger_efficiency.pdf}
     \caption{

with a muon+$\tauh$ monitoring trigger. The efficiencies shown here are used in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel.
The specific distribution shown is for genuine $\tau$ leptons and includes all used decay modes.
}
     \label{fig:htt_tt_trig}
\end{figure*}

The trigger efficiencies for electrons and muons are also measured with a tag-and-probe method.
Similar to the electron and muon identification and isolation efficiencies, the 
electron (muon) trigger efficiencies are measured in $\PZ\to\Pe\Pe$ ($\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$) events.
The denominator selection for the probe lepton requires the same identification and
isolation criteria used in the analysis. The efficiencies are measured as a function of
lepton $\pt$ and $\eta$.



\subsection{Drell--Yan Reweighting}
\label{sec:htt_dy_reweighting}
The simulated Monte Carlo Drell--Yan sample used in the analysis is simulated at leading order (LO)
using the \aMCATNLO generator discussed in section~\ref{sec:simulation}. To assess Monte Carlo to
data agreement a dedicated $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$ control region with high Drell--Yan purity was used.
The $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$ control region selected events from the Single Muon PD and requires the 
presence of two well-identified muons with $\pt > 25 \GeV$ and an invariant mass between 70 and 110\GeV.
With this selection criteria over 99\% of the events are attributed to $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$ decays.

Differences in the distributions of $m_{\ell\ell}$ and $\pt^{\ell\ell}$ between data and 
in simulations are observed in this control region. To correct for this, 2D weights based on these variables 
are derived and applied to simulated $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgt\Pgt, \ell\ell$ events in the signal region of the analysis. 
In addition, corrections depending on $\mjj$ are derived from the $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$ region and 
applied to the $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgt\Pgt, \ell\ell$ simulation for events with at least two jets passing the 
VBF category selection criteria. After this reweighting, good agreement between data in the 
$\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$ region and simulation is found for all other variables used in the analysis.
These derived corrections are also applied to the simulated samples of electroweak production of $\PZ$ 
bosons. Electroweak produced $\PZ$ bosons contribute up to 8\% of the $\PZ$ boson production in the VBF category.



\subsection{Hadronic Recoil Corrections}
Recoil corrections are applied to the Drell--Yan and $\PW+\text{jets}$ simulated background events 
as well as the simulated signal events for 
Higgs Bosons produced via the gluon fusion or VBF mechanisms. Recoil corrections correct for the
mismodeling of \etvecmiss in the simulated samples. A variable, $\vec{U}$, is defined as the 
vectorial difference of the measured \etvecmiss and the total transverse momentum of neurtrinos
originating from the decay of the boson.
\begin{equation}
\vec{U} = \etvecmiss - \vec{p}_{\text{T},\nu}
\end{equation}

For $\PZ$ bosons decaying leptonically to $\ell$, $\vec{U}$ can be expressed as,

\begin{equation}
\vec{U} = \vec{p}_{\text{T,B}} - \vec{H}_{\text{T}}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{H}_{\text{T}}$ is the transverse momentum of hadronic recoil and $\vec{p}_{\text{T,B}}$
is the leptonic recoil and is the transverse momentum of leptonically decaying $\PZ$, $\PW$, or Higgs Bosons.

Like the Drell--Yan Reweighting mentioned above, $\vec{U}$ is measured in $\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ events.
It is observed that the $\vec{H}_{\text{T}}$ from simulation in $\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ does not align with
the $\vec{H}_{\text{T}}$ from data. A reweighting method is derived to align the simulated distribution with 
data. The $\PZ/\Pgg^*\to\Pgm\Pgm$
final state is used because of the absence of neutrinos in the $\PZ$ decay making the comparison of
the simulation to data and derivation of the reweighting technique far more simple. For the measurement
and application of the corrections $\vec{U}$ is decomposed into two components, one which is
paralled to $\vec{p}_{\text{T,B}}$ ($\vec{U_{1}}$) and one which is orthogonal ($\vec{U_{2}}$).


\subsection{Generator Event Weights}
Generator weights are applied on a per event basis. Samples produced with the \aMCATNLO generator
contain both positive and negative event weights, as discussed in the Simulation chapter~\ref{sec:simulation}.
Negative generator weights in a sample reduces the effective statists of that sample. This reduction
in statistical power is often the trade off for increased precision in the modeling of a choosen
background or signal process.


\subsection{Luminosity Weighting}
The event weights for simulated events are scaled to the expected yields for each sample. A per-event
weight (W) is defined based on the number of generated events (N), the best theory predicted cross section
for the process ($\sigma$), and the integrated luminosity of the dataset being modeled 
($\mathcal{L}$), 35.9\fbinv.

\begin{equation}
\text{W} \, = \mathcal{L} \, \,  \frac{\sigma}{\text{N}}
\end{equation}

For samples with negative generator weights, N is redefined as the sum total of the event weights to
properly account for the negative event weights.




\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:htt_systematics}

The systematic uncertainty model for the $\htt$ study was critical to the success of the analysis.
The goal of the analysis was to reach an observed significane for the Higgs Boson of 5.0$\sigma$.
To achieve this the description of the expected background processes and Higgs Boson signal
needed to be as close to data as possible. The previous Monte Carlo Reweighting 
section~\ref{sec:mc_corrections} detailed this process. Many of the corrections and weights applied
to the simulated samples have associated unceratinties which must be represented in the
global fit. Other unceratinties come from the measurement of the data itself such as the uncertainty
on the integrated luminosity. In addition to these, there are also theoretical uncertainties on
aspects such as the production cross sections for the simulated backgrounds and Higgs Boson signals. 
These are all detailed in the sections below.


\subsection{Integrated Luminosity Uncertainties}
The total data taken by the CMS experiment in 2016 that is marked usable for physics is 35.9\fbinv. The uncertainty
on this 35.9\fbinv integrated luminosity value amounts to 2.5\%~\cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001}.


\subsection{Object Reconstruction, Identification and Trigger Uncertainties}
The total uncertainty in the $\tauh$ identification efficiency measurement for genuine $\tauh$ leptons is 
5\% mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:htt_tau_id_eff}.
The $\tauh$ are required to pass different identification criteria per channel
specifically aimed at reducing the chance of fake $\tauh$ originating from different background
processes in each final state. Because of the different anti-$\Pe$ and anti-$\Pgm$ discriminators
applied in each channel, the 5\% uncertainty is not fully correlated among all the di-$\Pgt$ channels.

The trigger efficiency uncertainty per $\tauh$ candidate amounts to 5\%. This leads to a total 
trigger uncertainty of 10\% for processes estimated from simulation in the $\tauh\tauh$ decay channel. 
This uncertainty is based off of the tag-and-probe trigger efficiency measurement in 
$\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ events detailed in section~\ref{sec:htt_trigger_eff}.

In the decay channels with muons or electrons, the uncertainties for the muon and electron identification, 
isolation, and trigger efficiencies lead to a total rate uncertainty of 2\% for muons and 2\% for electrons.


\subsection{Tau Fake Rate}
For events where muons or electrons are misidentified as $\tauh$ candidates, the $\tauh$ identification leads 
to rate uncertainties of 25\% and 12\%, respectively, per reconstructed $\tauh$ decay mode. These fake $\tauh$
dominantly come from $\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ events in the $\Pgm\tauh$ decay channel and $\PZ\to\Pe\Pe$ events 
in the $\Pe\tauh$ decay channel. Using $\mvis$ and the reconstructed 
$\tauh$ decay mode as the observables in the 0-jet category of the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels helps constrain these 
uncertainties during the signal extraction fit. The post-fit uncertainty in the rate of muons or electrons 
misidentified as $\tauh$ per decay mode becomes of the order of 5\%. This is an 80\% constraint for the muon
misidentified as $\tauh$ rate and a 40\% constraint on the electron misidentified as $\tauh$ rate.


\subsection{Energy Scales}
\subsubsection{Visible Tau Energy Scale}
An uncertainty of 1.2\% in the visible energy scale of genuine $\tauh$ leptons affects both the shape of the
signal and background distributions and the expected yields. The 1.2\% uncertainty is treated as uncorrelated 
among the different $\tauh$ decay modes: 1-prong, 1-prong+$\PGpz$, and 3-prong.
The magnitude of the uncertainty was determined based on the uncertainties on the measured $\tauh$ energy 
corrections in Section~\ref{sec:htt_tec}. The measurement was conducted in the $\Pgm\tauh$ final state and
does have some overlap with the $\Pgm\tauh$ channel signal regions. However, the event overlap is found to be
less than 50\% between the $\tauh$ energy correction/visible $\tauh$ energy scale measurement region and the
$\Pgm\tauh$ signal region used in this analysis.

The fit constrains the visible $\tauh$ energy scale uncertainty to about 0.3\%, a 75\% constraint, for all 
decay modes. The constraint mostly comes from highly populated regions with high $\tauh$ purity, for example,
the 0-jet and Boosted categories of the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\tauh\tauh$ channels. The constraint on the size of the 
uncertainty is explained by the addition of two other decay channels
with $\tauh$ candidates ($\tauh\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$) in addition to to the $\Pgm\tauh$ measurement region.
Additionally, the higher number of events in the Monte Carlo simulations and the finer categorization which 
leads to regions with a high $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ event purity also contribute to the post-fit constraint on the
visible tau energy scale.
Even in the most Boosted analysis categories, reconstructed $\tauh$ candidates typically have moderate 
$\pt$ (less than 100\GeV) and are
found in the barrel region of the detector. Tracks are well measured in the CMS detector in this $\pt$ range.
Therefore, the visible energy scale of genuine $\tauh$ leptons is fully correlated for all $\tauh$ leptons 
reconstructed in the same decay mode, irrespective of their $\pt$ and $\eta$. The uncertainties in the 
visible energy scale for genuine $\tauh$ leptons together contribute an uncertainty of 5\% to the measurement 
of the signal strength.


\subsubsection{Energy Scale for Fake Taus}
The energy scale uncertainty for muons or electrons
misidentified as $\tauh$ candidates is 1.5 or 3\%, respectively. It is uncorrelated between reconstructed $\tauh$ decay
modes. The fit constrains these uncertainties to about one third of their initial values. For events where quark- or 
gluon-initiated jets are misidentified as $\tauh$ candidates, a linear uncertainty that increases by 20\% per 100\GeV 
in $\tauh$ $\pt$ accounts for a potential mismodeling of the jet$\to\tauh$ misidentification rate as a
function of the $\tauh$ $\pt$ in simulations. The uncertainty has been determined from a region enriched in $\PW+\text{jets}$ 
events, using events in the $\Pgm\tauh$ final state, characterized by a large transverse mass 
between the $\etvecmiss$ and the muon~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dfa,CMS-PAS-TAU-16-002}.

\subsubsection{Jet Energy Scale}
The uncertainties in the jet energy scale depend on the $\pt$ and $\eta$ of the jet~\cite{CMS-JME-10-011}.
They are factorized into 27 distinct uncorrelated contributions. These factorized uncertainties target jet related 
mismodeling for different CMS subdetectors, namely ECAL and HCAL, uncertainties in jet energy corrections, timing dependance,
high $\pt$ jet extrapolations uncertainties, and large $\abs\eta$ jet related uncertainties. The uncertainties
affect the $\pt$ of each jet in an event. As the $\pt$ for each jet increasing or decreasing, the 
the number of jets with passing $\pt > 30\GeV$ is recomputed as is the $\mjj$ for each event. The adjusted number of
jets and $\mjj$ are used to determine the new, shifted, event categorization. For example,
events can shift between the 0-jet and Boosted category if a jet has a $\pt$ value near 30\GeV that shifts into
or out of categorization as a jet by the analysis (jet $\pt > 30\GeV$). As $\mjj$ is shifted, the shifted $\mjj$ value is used
to plot the event in the 2D VBF distribution.


\subsubsection{MET Energy Scale}
The \etvecmiss scale uncertainties~\cite{CMS-JME-12-002} are computed event-by-event and affect the normalization of 
various processes through the event selection in the $\ell\tauh$ channels which employ the low-\MT,
$\MT < 50\GeV$ criteria. The \etvecmiss scale uncertainties also affect event distributions through the 
propagation of these uncertainties 
to the di-$\Pgt$ mass $\mtt$. The \etvecmiss scale uncertainties which have the largest impact on the signal significance
in this analysis are from jet related uncertainties and unclustered energy deposits in the detector.
The unclustered energy deposites come from four independent sources related to the tracker, ECAL, HCAL, and 
forward calorimeter subdetectors. The jet related \etvecmiss scale uncertainties arise from uncertainties
in the jet energy scale measurement. As the scale of the jet energy is varied, these changes are propagated to
the \etvecmiss. The combination of both sources of uncertainties in 
the \etvecmiss scale leads to an uncertainty of about 10\% in the measured signal strength.


\subsubsection{Electron And Muon Energy Scale}
The uncertainty in the electron energy scale is 2.5\% in the endcaps and 1\% in the barrel of the detector. 
It is only relevant in the $\Pe\Pgm$ decay channel, where it affects the final distributions shape and yield.
In all channels, the effect of the uncertainty in the muon energy scale is negligible and is not included
in the systematic model.


\subsection{b-Tagging Uncertainties}
The $\htt$ analysis only applies a b-tagged jet selection criteria in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel where the number
of b-tagged jets must equal zero in the signal region. The rate uncertainty related to discarding events 
with a b-tagged jet in the $\Pe\Pgm$ channel is up to 5\% for the $\ttbar$ background. The uncertainty 
in the mistagging rate of gluon and light-flavor jets is negligible.


%In the 0-jet category of the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels, the relative contribution of $\tauh$ in a given
%reconstructed decay mode is allowed to fluctuate by 3\% to account for the possibility that the reconstruction and
%identification efficiencies are different for each decay mode. This uncertainty has been measured in a region enriched 
%in $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ events with one $\Pgt$ lepton decaying hadronically and the other one decaying to a muon, by 
%comparing the level of agreement in exclusive bins of the reconstructed $\tauh$ decay mode, after adjusting the inclusive 
%normalization of the $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ simulation to its best-fit value. The effect of migration between the reconstructed 
%$\tauh$ decay modes is negligible in other categories, where
%all decay modes are treated together.


\subsection{Background Estimation Uncertainties}
\subsubsection{Drell--Yan Uncertainties}
The $\PZ\to\Pgt\Pgt$ background yield and distribution are corrected based on the agreement between data and the 
background prediction in a control region enriched in the $\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ events, as explained in 
Section~\ref{sec:htt_dy_reweighting}. The extrapolation uncertainty related to kinematic differences between the selections 
in the signal and control regions ranges between 3 and 10\%, depending
on the category. Shape uncertainties related to the uncertainties in the applied corrections are considered.
They reach 20\% for some ranges of $\mjj$ in the VBF category, but are more modest in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel where
the uncertainties range from 0\% in the lowest $\mjj$ region to 6\% in the $500\GeV < \mjj < 800\GeV$ region.
These uncertainties arise from the different level of agreement between data and simulation in the 
$\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ control region obtained when varying the threshold on the muon $\pt$.


\subsubsection{$\PW+\text{jets}$ Uncertainties}
The uncertainties in the $\PW+\text{jets}$ event yield for the $\Pgm\tauh$ and $\Pe\tauh$ channels are determined 
from their $\PW+\text{jets}$ control regions. The uncertainties account for the statistical uncertainties of the
data and $\PW+\text{jets}$ simulated samples. An extrapolation uncertainty is also determined which accounts for
the high-\MT ($\MT>80\GeV$) control regions to the low-\MT ($\MT<50\GeV$) signal regions scaling.
These uncertainties ranges from 5 to 10\%.
% and is obtained by comparing the \MT distributions of simulated and observed 
%$\PZ\to\Pgm\Pgm$ events where one of the muons is removed and the \etvecmiss adjusted accordingly, to mimic 
%$\PW+\text{jets}$ events. The reconstructed invariant mass of the parent boson in the rest frame is multiplied by the 
%ratio of the $\PW$ and $\PZ$ boson masses before removing the muon.

In the $\tauh\tauh$ and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels, where the $\PW+\text{jets}$ background is estimated from simulation, the 
uncertainty on the yield of this small background is 4\% and 20\%, respectively. The larger value for the 
$\Pe\Pgm$ channel includes uncertainties in the misidentification rates of jets as electrons and muons, whereas the 
uncertainty in the misidentification rate of jets as $\tauh$ candidates in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel is accounted for 
by the linear uncertainty as a function of the $\tauh$ $\pt$ described earlier.


\subsubsection{QCD Multijet Uncertainties}
The uncertainty in the QCD multijet background yield in the $\ell\tauh$ and $\Pe\Pgm$ channels ranges from 10 to 20\%.
They are category dependant and account for the uncertainty on the extrapolation from the same-sign measurement to 
the opposite-sign signal regions. In the  $\ell\tauh$ channels, statistical uncertainties in the QCD multijet
control regions are automatically taken into acount by the global fit with the control regions and signal regions.

In the $\tauh\tauh$ channel, the uncertainty in the QCD mutlijet background yield reflects a combination of the statistical
uncertainties obtained from fitting the dedicated control regions with $\tauh$ candidates passing relaxed isolation 
criteria, and for extrapolation uncertainties to the signal region. Limited 
disagreement between prediction and data in signal-free regions with various loose isolation criteria is also accounted
for in the QCD multijet uncertainties. 

The level of agreement for the $\tauh\tauh$ QCD multijet estimation method
is determined in signal free regions where the $\tauh$ have loosened isolation requirements and at least
one of the $\tauh$ must not meet the signal region \texttt{Tight Tau MVA} criteria. A schematic depiction
of the signal region, QCD multijet control region, and method validation regions are in 
figure~\ref{fig:htt_tautau_qcd_schematic2}.

\begin{figure*}[htbp]

     \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{higgs_to_taus/plots/tautau_QCD_signal_region.pdf}

signal region, the method closure can be assessed.
     }
     \label{fig:htt_tautau_qcd_schematic2}
\end{figure*}

The QCD multijet estimation method in the $\tauh\tauh$ channel is found to agree well when validated using closure
checks in the loosened isolation control regions depicted in figure~\ref{fig:htt_tautau_qcd_schematic2}.
Closure is estimated by comparing the ``predicted'' QCD multijet yield in the opposite-sign
\texttt{Tighter Validation Region} against the ``measured'' QCD multijet yield in the same region. 
The ``measured'' QCD multijet yield in the \texttt{Tighter Validation Region} is calculated as 
$\text{QCD multijet} = \text{data} - \text{Other Backgrounds}$ just like equation~\ref{eqn:qcd_eqn}.
The ``predicted'' QCD multijet yield in the same region comes from multipling the measured yield in the
opposite-sign \texttt{Looser Validation Region} by a loose-to-tight scale factor derived in the same-sign
region just like equation~\ref{eqn:htt_tt_qcd_sf}. The closure values for the three analysis cateogires
is shown in table~\ref{tab:htt_tt_qcd_closure} along with the associated statistical uncertainty on the
measurement and the $\tauh\tauh$ channel QCD multijet estimation method systematic uncertainty. The 
systematic uncertainty on the method is added in quadriture with the statistical uncertainty on the
loose-to-tight scale factor to arrive at a total per category uncertainty for QCD multijet estimation.

scale factor. The final uncertainty values used in the analysis, the QCD total uncertainty is the sum in 
quadriture of the QCD method systematic uncertainty and QCD method statistical uncertainty.
}
\end{table*}


\subsubsection{\ttbar Uncertainties}
The uncertainty from the fit in the \ttbar control region, discussed in section~\ref{sec:background_estimation}, 
is automatically propagated to the signal regions. It results in an uncertainty of about 5\% on the 
\ttbar cross section. Per-channel uncertainties related to the object reconstruction and identification are 
considered when extrapolating from the $\Pe\Pgm$ final state to the others. The \ttbar simulation is corrected 
for differences in the top quark $\pt$ distributions observed between data and simulation. An uncertainty 
in the correction is taken into account.


\subsubsection{Other Background Uncertainties}
The combined systematic uncertainty in the background yield arising from diboson and single top quark production 
processes is estimated to be 5\%
on the basis of recent CMS measurements~\cite{Khachatryan:2016tgp,Sirunyan:2016cdg}.


\subsection{Theoretical Uncertainties for Higgs Boson}
Rate and acceptance uncertainties for the Higgs Boson signal processes are derived from theoretical calculations.
They are largely due to uncertainties in the PDFs, variations of the QCD renormalization and factorization scales,
and uncertainties in the modelling of parton showers.
The magnitude of the rate uncertainty depends on the production process and on the event category.

The inclusive uncertainty related to the PDFs amounts to 3.2, 2.1, 1.9, and 1.6\%, respectively, for 
the $ \cPg\cPg\PH $, VBF, $\PW\PH$, and $\PZ\PH$ production modes~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. The
corresponding uncertainty for the variation of the renormalization and factorization scales is 
3.9, 0.4, 0.7, and 3.8\%, respectively~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.
The PDF-based acceptance uncertainties related to the particular selection criteria used in this analysis are less 
than 1\% for the $\cPg\cPg\PH$ and VBF production mechanisms. The acceptance uncertainties for VBF production 
in the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties are less than 1\%, while the corresponding 
uncertainties for the $\cPg\cPg\PH$ process are treated as shape uncertainties. The renormalization and 
factorization scale uncertainties increase linearly with $\pth$ and $\mjj$.

The $\pt$ distribution of the Higgs Boson in the {\POWHEG2.0} simulations is tuned to match more closely
the next-to-NLO (NNLO) plus next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) prediction in the
\textsc{HRes2.1} generator~\cite{deFlorian:2012mx,Grazzini:2013mca}.
The signal acceptance changes with the variation of the parton shower tune in \HERWIG++ 2.6 samples~\cite{Bellm:2013hwb} 
are considered as additional uncertainties, and amount to up to 7\% in the Boosted category. The theoretical 
uncertainty in the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to $\Pgt$ leptons is equal to 2.1\%~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

The theoretical uncertainties in the signal production depend on the jet multiplicity. This effect is included 
by following the prescriptions in Ref.~\cite{Stewart:2011cf}. These uncertainties need to be taken into account because 
the definitions of the three categories used in the analysis are based partially on the number of reconstructed 
jets. Additional shape uncertainties for boosted Higgs Bosons, related to the treatment of the top quark mass in 
the calculations, are considered for signal events with $\pth>150\GeV$.

Theory uncertainties in the signal prediction contribute an uncertainty of 10\% to the measurement of the signal strength.


\subsection{Other uncertainties}
There are additional uncertainties related to the finite number of simulated events and to the limited number 
of events in data control regions which are taken into account. They are considered for all bins of the 
distributions used to extract the results. In total, these per-bin uncertainties contribute an uncertainty of 
about 12\% to the signal strength measurement where the majority of this uncertainty comes from sparsely populated 
shape tamples in the VBF category.


\subsection{Systematic Model Summary}
The systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:htt_uncertainties}.

\caption{Sources of systematic uncertainty. If the global fit to the signal and control regions, described 
in the next section, significantly constrains these uncertainties, the values of the uncertainties after 
the global fit are indicated in the third column. The acronyms CR and ID stand for control region and 
identification, respectively.}
