\section{VH Summary}
A search for the standard model Higgs boson based on data collected in proton-proton collisions by the
CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV focusing on the
two $\PW\PH$ and $\PZ\PH$ associated production processes has been presented. Event
categories have been split into three lepton final states targeting $\PW\PH$ production
and four lepton final states targeting $\PZ\PH$ production. The results are extracted
via maximum likelihood fits using the visible di-$\Pgt$ mass for the $\PW\PH$
final states and full di-$\Pgt$ mass for the $\PZ\PH$ final states. 
%Observed limits of 4.7 
%(expected 2.0) are placed on the Higgs boson associated production processes 
%times the SM prediction for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09\GeV. 
The best fit signal
strength is $\mu = 2.54 ^{+1.35} _{-1.26}$ ($\mu = 1.00 ^{+1.08} _{-0.97}$ expected) 
for a significance of 2.3 standard deviations (1.0 expected).

Combining this analysis with the previous 13\TeV $ggH$ and VFB targeted $\htt$ 
analysis~\cite{cms_13TeV_htt_jhep_2017}, we place the tightest constraints
on the $\htt$ process. 
The best fit signal strength is $\mu = 1.24 ^{+0.29} _{-0.27}$ leading to an
observed significance of 5.5 standard deviations (4.8 expected). 
The combination leads to a significant increase in constraint for the coupling
of the Higgs boson to vector bosons, the coupling to fermions is not greatly
affected. The resulting measured couplings are consistent with SM predictions
within one standard deviation.
